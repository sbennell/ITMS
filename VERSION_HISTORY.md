# Version History

All notable changes to the Asset Management System are documented in this file.

---

## [1.28.5] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- Renamed the top Criticality tier from "Crown Jewel" to "Critical". "Crown Jewel" is MACS-specific terminology and this system is also used by non-MACS schools; the MACS Asset Management Standard only requires "a tier rating system" for criticality, it doesn't mandate that literal label, so this doesn't affect MACS compliance while being clearer for everyone else. The underlying stored value is unchanged.

### Technical Details

- Updated `CRITICALITY_LABELS` in `apps/web/src/lib/utils.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/import.ts`, and `apps/api/src/routes/software.ts`, plus the "Crown Jewel" wording in the Criticality field's hover-help text in `AssetForm.tsx` and `SoftwareForm.tsx`

---

## [1.28.4] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- Data Classification labels now match the exact wording of the MACS Data Security Management Standard: "Internal" is now "Business Use" and "Sensitive" is now "Confidential" (the underlying stored values are unchanged, so existing records, exports, and imports keep working - only the displayed/exported text changed).

### Technical Details

- Updated `DATA_CLASSIFICATION_LABELS` in `apps/web/src/lib/utils.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/import.ts`, and `apps/api/src/routes/software.ts` (all three previously duplicated the same label map)

---

## [1.28.3] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed

- Fixed `update.ps1` leaving the server's git checkout in a broken, diverged state ("ahead of origin by N commits" with unmerged `package-lock.json`) after repeated updates. The old flow (`git stash` / `git pull` / `git stash pop`) never checked whether the stash-pop actually succeeded, so when a prior `npm install` had left `package-lock.json` modified locally (platform-specific optional dependencies resolve differently) and a later pull also touched that file, the stash-pop silently conflicted and the script carried on regardless - compounding across runs. Replaced with fetch + hard-reset to `origin/<branch>`, which always converges the tree to exactly what's on GitHub and self-heals from any previously diverged/conflicted state. `.env` is gitignored and untouched by this either way.

### Technical Details

- `update.ps1`: "Pulling latest code" step now does `git fetch origin $Branch` then `git reset --hard origin/$Branch` instead of `git stash` / `git pull` / `git stash pop`
- Verified against a reproduction of the exact failure (local commit + local `package-lock.json` drift + origin ahead with a conflicting change to the same file) using a throwaway test repo - confirmed the new logic recovers to a clean tree matching origin in all cases
- **If your server is currently stuck in this state**, run this once by hand in `C:\ITMS\app` to recover before the next update: `git reset --hard origin/main` (discards the local-only commits and the conflicted merge; your `.env` and database are untouched)

---

## [1.28.2] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed

- Fixed "Import Software assetss" (double s) in Settings > Data - the software import panel's singular noun was accidentally set to the already-plural "software assets", which then had another "s" appended by the pluralization logic. Also corrected the "Update existing software assets" checkbox label to match.

---

## [1.28.1] - 2026-07-23

### Changed

- Shortened the Data Import/Export description text in Settings > Data

---

## [1.28.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Software Register Import**: New "Import Software items" section in Settings > Data (admin only), mirroring the existing hardware asset import - upload an Excel/CSV file to create or update software items, with Skip Duplicates / Update Existing options. Accepts the same column headers as the Software export (including Compliance/Governance fields), so a downloaded export can be edited and re-uploaded directly. Publisher, Category, and Supplier values are matched to existing lookups or auto-created, same as hardware import. Invalid Status/Criticality/Data Classification/Hosting/Support Type/Internet Facing values are rejected per-row with a clear error instead of silently dropped

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/routes/software.ts`: new `POST /import` route (`requireAdmin`, in addition to the router-level `canAccessSoftware` gate), with its own `multer.memoryStorage()` instance separate from the attachment upload's `diskStorage`; duplicates the `parseDate`/`resolveEnumValue`/`getCellString` helpers and `VALID_SOFTWARE_STATUS` list (mirroring the equivalent hardware helpers in `import.ts`, kept local since they aren't exported)
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`: new `importSoftware()` function mirroring `importAssets()`
- `apps/web/src/pages/settings/DataTab.tsx`: extracted the shared file-upload/options/results UI into a reusable `ImportPanel` component, used for both the existing hardware import and the new software import section

---

## [1.27.5] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Moved "Export Software Register" next to "Export Hardware Asset Register" in Settings > Data (previously in its own section below), and renamed "Export Asset Register" to "Export Hardware Asset Register" for clarity alongside the software export

### Technical Details

- `apps/web/src/pages/settings/DataTab.tsx`: merged the separate "Software" export section into the main export button row; updated button label

---

## [1.27.4] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where exporting the full Asset Register and re-importing that same file dropped all Compliance/Governance data (Business Purpose, Business Owner, Technical Owner, Version, Criticality, Data Classification, Hosting, Support Type, Internet Facing) - the importer had never been taught to read these columns back in, even though the export had included them since they were added. Re-importing an export now round-trips these fields correctly, whether the cell contains the exported human label (e.g. "High") or the raw stored value (e.g. "HIGH") - invalid values are rejected with a clear error, same as the existing Status/Condition validation.

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/routes/import.ts`: added column-header mappings for `businessPurpose`/`businessOwner`/`technicalOwner`/`version`/`criticalityTier`/`dataClassification`/`hostingType`/`supportType`/`internetFacing`; new `resolveEnumValue()` helper resolves a cell's text back to its enum key by matching either the raw key or the human label (case-insensitive), used for the four tier/classification fields; `internetFacing` accepts Yes/No/true/false (case-insensitive); unrecognized values produce a per-row import error instead of silently dropping data

---

## [1.27.3] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Renamed the hardware worksheet in the "Export for MACS" workbook from "MACS Asset Register" to "Hardware", so it pairs clearly alongside the "Software" worksheet

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/routes/import.ts`: `/export-macs` now names the first worksheet `Hardware` instead of `MACS Asset Register`

---

## [1.27.2] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- The "Export for MACS" download now includes a second worksheet, "Software", with the same minimum MACS-required fields as the hardware sheet, sourced from the Software register (plus a Name column, since a software category alone doesn't identify a specific item)

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/routes/import.ts`: new `SOFTWARE_MACS_COLUMNS` array (mirrors `MACS_COLUMNS` with `initialInstallDate`/`licenseExpiration` in place of `acquiredDate`/`endOfLifeDate`, plus `name`); `/export-macs` now also queries `prisma.software.findMany()` and adds a second worksheet to the same workbook
- `apps/web/src/pages/settings/DataTab.tsx`: updated the "Export for MACS" button's tooltip to mention both worksheets

---

## [1.27.1] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Renamed "Assets" to "Hardware Assets" and "Software" to "Software Assets" in the sidebar nav, list page headings, and the Settings > Users permission checkboxes, to make the distinction between the two registers clearer. URLs (`/assets`, `/software`), buttons (Add Asset, Export Asset Register, etc.), and form titles are unchanged.

### Technical Details

- `apps/web/src/components/Layout.tsx`: `NAV_ITEMS` display names updated
- `apps/web/src/pages/AssetList.tsx`, `SoftwareList.tsx`: H1 heading text updated
- `apps/web/src/pages/settings/UsersTab.tsx`: `PERMISSION_FIELDS` labels updated

---

## [1.27.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Software Register**: New "Software" section in the sidebar, fully separate from hardware Assets - its own list/detail/add/edit pages, its own permission toggle (`Software`, off by default for existing USER accounts), and its own Publisher/Category lookup tables
- Tracks licensing/deployment details (publisher, category, version, URL, app store, deployment mechanism, license expiration, license count, supplier) alongside the same Compliance/Governance fields as hardware assets (business purpose, business/technical owner, criticality, data classification, hosting, support type, internet facing)
- **File Attachments**: Real working file upload/download for Software items (PDF, Word, Excel, PNG, JPEG; 10MB limit) - stored under a configurable `UPLOAD_DIR` (defaults to `./uploads`), with automatic cleanup on delete
- **Change History**: Full audit log for Software (create/update/attachment add/remove), mirroring the existing Asset audit log
- **Software Export**: New admin-only Excel export (Settings > Data Import/Export)
- Seeded a starter set of Software Categories (Operating System, Productivity Suite, Security, Educational, Administration/SIS, Creative, Communication)

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: new `Software`, `SoftwarePublisher`, `SoftwareCategory`, `SoftwareAttachment`, `SoftwareAuditLog` models; `Supplier` is reused (not duplicated) as the software vendor lookup; new `canAccessSoftware` boolean on `User` (defaults `false`, unlike the other feature flags)
- `apps/api/src/routes/software.ts`: new route file mirroring `assets.ts`'s CRUD/pagination/audit-log/export patterns; attachment routes use `multer.diskStorage()` with a file-type allowlist and size limit (no existing disk-storage pattern to mirror - this is new)
- `apps/api/src/routes/lookups.ts`: added `SoftwarePublisher`/`SoftwareCategory` CRUD sections, same shape as the existing four lookups
- `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`: `canAccessSoftware` threaded through the `PermissionFlag` union, `PERMISSION_FLAGS` array, session typing, login/session population, response bodies, and `/users` `select` clauses
- `apps/web/src/pages/SoftwareList.tsx`, `SoftwareDetail.tsx`, `SoftwareForm.tsx`: new pages mirroring the Asset equivalents structurally, reusing `FieldLabel` for form help tooltips and the existing Criticality/Data Classification/Hosting/Support label maps from `utils.ts`; new `SOFTWARE_STATUS_LABELS`/`_COLORS` (Planned/Active/Trial/Decommissioned) since hardware's status set doesn't fit software
- `apps/web/src/components/Layout.tsx` / `App.tsx`: new "Software" nav item and `/software` routes, permission-gated via `PermissionRoute`
- `apps/web/src/pages/settings/UsersTab.tsx`, `LookupsTab.tsx`, `DataTab.tsx`: extended with the new permission toggle, lookup managers, and export button
- New `UPLOAD_DIR` environment variable (`.env.example`, `doc/MANUAL_INSTALL.md`, `install.ps1`); the automated installer and backup script now also create/zip-back-up `data\uploads` alongside the database
- No changes to any existing hardware Asset routes, models, or pages - fully additive except for the shared `User`/permission plumbing

---

## [1.26.4] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- Added "DET Managed Hosted" as a Hosting option for assets, alongside On-Premises, School Managed Cloud, MACS Managed Cloud, and Third-Party Managed Cloud

### Technical Details

- `apps/web/src/lib/utils.ts`: added `DET_HOSTED: 'DET Managed Hosted'` to `HOSTING_LABELS`
- `apps/api/src/routes/import.ts`: mirrored the same entry in its server-side `HOSTING_LABELS` copy, used by the asset register export

---

## [1.26.3] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- Field help tooltips (added in 1.26.2) are now shown on the Asset Form (Add/Edit) only. Removed from the read-only Asset Detail page based on feedback

### Technical Details

- `apps/web/src/pages/AssetDetail.tsx`: reverted to plain `dt` labels with no `help`/`HelpCircle` rendering; `DetailRow` dropped the `help` prop
- `apps/web/src/pages/AssetForm.tsx` and `apps/web/src/components/FieldLabel.tsx` unchanged

---

## [1.26.2] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Field Help Tooltips**: Every field label on the Asset Form and Asset Detail page now shows a small (?) icon that explains what the field means on hover - covers all fields, from basics like Serial Number and Category through to the newer Compliance/Governance fields (Criticality, Data Classification, Hosting, Support Type, etc.)

### Technical Details

- `apps/web/src/components/FieldLabel.tsx`: new reusable component - renders a label with an optional `help` tooltip (native `title` attribute on a `HelpCircle` icon from lucide-react, wrapped in a `<span>` since Lucide's icon props don't include `title` directly)
- `apps/web/src/pages/AssetForm.tsx`: every `<label>` replaced with `<FieldLabel text=".." help=".." />`
- `apps/web/src/pages/AssetDetail.tsx`: `DetailRow` gained an optional `help` prop rendering the same icon/tooltip pattern next to each `dt`; the four hand-rolled detail rows (Assigned To, IP Addresses, Password, Criticality) got the icon added inline

---

## [1.26.1] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **MACS Asset Register Export**: New "Export for MACS" button (Settings > Data Import/Export, admin only) downloads a focused spreadsheet containing just the 17 minimum required fields from the MACS IT Security Asset Management Standard, in the standard's order (Unique ID, Type of Asset, Business Purpose/Function, Business Owner, Technical Owner, Date of Acquisition, Status, Date of Decommissioning, Supplier, Version, End-of-Life Support Date, Criticality Category, Data Classification, Hosting, Support, Internet Facing, Supporting Notes) - a smaller, audit-ready alternative to the full asset export

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/routes/import.ts`: new `GET /export-macs` route and `MACS_COLUMNS` array, reusing the existing `CRITICALITY_LABELS`/`DATA_CLASSIFICATION_LABELS`/`HOSTING_LABELS`/`SUPPORT_LABELS` maps for human-readable values. Same `requireAdmin` gate as the existing `/export` route - unchanged
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`: new `exportAssetsMacs()` helper
- `apps/web/src/pages/settings/DataTab.tsx`: new "Export for MACS" button alongside "Export Asset Register"

---

## [1.26.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **MACS Asset Register Compliance Fields**: Assets now carry a "Compliance / Governance" section - Business Purpose, Business Owner, Technical Owner, Version, Criticality (Low/Medium/High/Crown Jewel), Data Classification (Public/Internal/Sensitive/Restricted), Hosting (On-Premises/School Managed Cloud/MACS Managed Cloud/Third-Party Managed Cloud), Support Type (In-house IT/SaaS/Vendor Supported), and Internet Facing (Yes/No/Unknown). All fields are optional so existing assets keep saving/editing unchanged
- Added a new `Planned` status option for assets that are budgeted/approved but not yet acquired
- The asset list now shows a Criticality column, and the full asset export (Settings > Data Import/Export, admin only) includes all the new compliance columns with human-readable labels
- The Reports > Stocktake Review tab now notes that it also satisfies the MACS annual asset register review requirement (via the existing Last Review Date tracking)

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: added nullable `businessPurpose`, `businessOwner`, `technicalOwner`, `version`, `criticalityTier`, `dataClassification`, `hostingType`, `supportType`, `internetFacing` columns to `Asset`. No lookup tables - these are fixed, standard-mandated enumerations rendered via label maps, consistent with how `status`/`condition` are already handled
- `apps/web/src/lib/utils.ts`: new `CRITICALITY_LABELS`/`_COLORS`, `DATA_CLASSIFICATION_LABELS`/`_COLORS`, `HOSTING_LABELS`, `SUPPORT_LABELS` maps; added `Planned` to `STATUS_LABELS`/`STATUS_COLORS`
- `apps/api/src/routes/assets.ts`: `POST /` and `PUT /:id` read/write the new fields; bulk-update already supported them for free via its generic field pass-through
- `apps/api/src/routes/import.ts`: `/export` route adds the 9 new columns (server-side label maps mirror the frontend's, exporting human-readable values); `VALID_STATUS` accepts `Planned`. Export/import routes remain admin-only, unchanged
- `apps/web/src/pages/AssetForm.tsx`, `AssetDetail.tsx`, `AssetList.tsx`: new "Compliance / Governance" form/detail section and a Criticality list column
- Scope: hardware assets only - software/SaaS/cloud asset tracking is not yet modeled in ITMS; "to-be-decommissioned" is inferred from a future Decommission Date rather than a dedicated status value

---

## [1.25.1] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Customizable Student Export Fields**: The Students page "Export" button now opens a field picker instead of exporting a fixed set of columns. Choose any combination of 9 student fields (name, home group, year level, status, email, username, edupass username, birthdate) and 14 asset fields (item number, category, manufacturer, model, serial number, description, status, condition, location, acquired date, warranty expiration, order number, supplier, comments), with the previous default columns pre-checked and "Select All" / "Select None" shortcuts

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/routes/students.ts`: `GET /students/export` now accepts `?fields=` (comma-separated keys), validated against `STUDENT_EXPORT_FIELDS`/`ASSET_EXPORT_FIELDS` whitelists; builds the Prisma `select` and worksheet columns dynamically from the requested fields, with `ASSET_FIELD_SELECT` mapping relation fields (category/manufacturer/location/supplier) to their nested selects. Falls back to the prior default column set when `fields` is omitted; 400s if nothing is selected. Rows are only duplicated per asset when at least one asset field is requested
- `apps/web/src/components/StudentExportModal.tsx`: new modal with grouped checkboxes for student vs. asset fields, replacing the old one-click export button
- `apps/web/src/pages/StudentList.tsx`: "Export" button now opens `StudentExportModal` instead of calling the export URL directly
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`: `getStudentsExportUrl()` accepts an optional `fields: string[]` and appends it as a comma-separated query param

---

## [1.25.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- **Export Students with Assigned Assets**: New "Export" button on the Students page downloads an Excel file of the currently filtered student list. One row per assigned asset (item number, category, manufacturer, model, serial number) alongside the student's name, home group, year level, status, and email; students with no assets get a single row with blank asset columns

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/routes/students.ts`: new `GET /students/export` route reuses the list view's filter logic (extracted into `buildStudentWhere`), includes each student's `assets` relation (with category/manufacturer), and streams an ExcelJS workbook (`students-export-YYYY-MM-DD.xlsx`, one row per student-asset pair) following the same pattern as `GET /import/export` for assets
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`: `getStudentsExportUrl()` builds the export URL from the active search/status/schoolYear/homeGroup filters
- `apps/web/src/pages/StudentList.tsx`: new "Export" button next to "Login Cards" opens the export URL with current filters applied

---

## [1.24.2] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **Login Card Filename for Single Student**: Downloading a login card for one student now names the file `login-card-firstname-lastname-homegroup.pdf` instead of just the surname, making it easier to identify when downloading multiple students' cards individually

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/routes/students.ts`: `GET /login-cards` filename logic for the `studentId` case now slugifies and joins `firstName`, `surname`, and `homeGroup` (skipping any that are empty)

---

## [1.24.1] - 2026-07-14

### Changed

- **Split "View Passwords" into Separate Device and Student Toggles**: The single `canViewPasswords` permission from 1.24.0 is now two independent toggles - "View device passwords" and "View student passwords" - so a user can be granted visibility into one without the other (e.g. an asset technician who shouldn't see student login credentials, or a student-office clerk who shouldn't see device passwords)

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: `User.canViewPasswords` replaced with `canViewDevicePasswords` and `canViewStudentPasswords`, both `Boolean @default(true)`
- `apps/api/src/lib/redact.ts`: split into `canViewDevicePasswords(req)`/`canViewStudentPasswords(req)`; `apps/api/src/routes/assets.ts` uses the device variant, `apps/api/src/routes/students.ts` (including the `GET /login-cards` gate) uses the student variant
- `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`: `PermissionFlag`/`PERMISSION_FLAGS`/`SessionData` updated to the two flags
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts`, `UsersTab.tsx`, `AssetDetail.tsx`, `AssetForm.tsx`, `StudentDetail.tsx`, `StudentList.tsx`: updated to check the appropriate one of the two flags instead of a single combined flag

---

## [1.24.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Per-User Feature Permissions**
  - USER accounts can now be scoped to just the areas they need instead of getting full access by default. Five independent toggles per user, set in Settings > Users: Assets (incl. label printing), Students, Stocktake, Reports & Network/IPAM, and a separate "View device/student passwords" toggle
  - ADMIN accounts are unaffected and always have full access - the toggles only ever restrict USER accounts
  - Restricted users only see the nav items, routes, and Settings tabs they have permission for; navigating directly to a blocked URL redirects to the first area they do have access to
  - New users created via Settings > Users default to every toggle unchecked (admin must explicitly grant each area); existing accounts are unaffected by the upgrade (all toggles default to enabled) so nothing changes for current users

### Security

- **Real Server-Side Password Redaction**: `Asset.devicePassword` and `Student.password` were previously sent to the browser in full and only masked in the UI (visible via dev tools/network inspection regardless of the "click to reveal" flow). They're now stripped from the API response entirely for any user without the new "View passwords" permission
- **Settings Lock-Down**: Settings > Lookups, General, Networking, Data, and Users are now admin-only (both the tab in the UI and the underlying API routes) - previously any logged-in user could edit categories/locations/organization settings with no backend check, which would have let a restricted account bypass the new area permissions entirely
- **Student Login Cards Gated**: `GET /students/login-cards` (whose whole purpose is printing a student's password on a card) now requires the "View passwords" permission instead of just being logged in

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma`: `User` gains `canAccessAssets`, `canAccessStudents`, `canAccessStocktake`, `canAccessReports` (covers Reports and Network/IPAM), and `canViewPasswords`, all `Boolean @default(true)`
- `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`: new `requirePermission(flag)`/`requireAnyPermission(...flags)` middleware (ADMIN always bypasses); session and `/status`/`/login`/`/users` payloads extended with the 5 flags
- `apps/api/src/lib/redact.ts` (new): `redactAssetPassword`/`redactStudentPassword` helpers, applied at every response boundary that returns a full asset or student row
- `apps/api/src/routes/labels.ts`: per-asset label routes gated by `canAccessAssets`; the asset-agnostic condition-sheet route accepts `canAccessAssets` OR `canAccessStocktake`; `PUT /settings` (global label defaults) is admin-only, matching the General tab lock-down
- `apps/web/src/App.tsx`: `AuthContext` gains `hasPermission()`; new `PermissionRoute` component (`apps/web/src/components/PermissionRoute.tsx`) guards each area route and redirects to the user's first accessible area
- `apps/web/src/pages/AssetForm.tsx`: fixes a data-loss edge case introduced by redaction - a user without "View passwords" editing an asset that has one set would previously see a blank field (since the API now returns `null`) and any save would wipe the real stored password; the field is now omitted from the update payload entirely when the user lacks permission, leaving the existing value untouched

---

## [1.23.0] - 2026-07-14

### Security

- **CORS Misconfiguration Fixed** - In production, the API reflected any request's `Origin` header (`origin: true`) while also allowing credentials, letting any external website issue authenticated cross-origin requests using a logged-in user's session cookie. The frontend is served same-origin by this same server, so cross-origin API access was never actually needed in production - CORS is now disabled outright there (`origin: false`), with the permissive `localhost` regex kept only for the Vite dev server.
- **Session Cookie Hardening** - The `secure` flag was hardcoded to `false` even in production (despite a comment saying otherwise), and no `sameSite` attribute was set. Cookies now default to `sameSite: 'lax'`, and `secure` is now driven by a new `COOKIE_SECURE` env var (still defaulting to `false` to match the plain-HTTP LAN deployments this app ships to via `install.ps1`; set to `true` if you terminate HTTPS in front of it).
- **`SESSION_SECRET` Fallback Removed** - The server previously fell back to a hardcoded, publicly-known secret if `SESSION_SECRET` was unset, which would let an attacker forge session cookies. It now refuses to start in production without one (`install.ps1` already generates and sets this automatically for every install, so this shouldn't affect existing deployments).
- **Login Rate Limiting** - `POST /api/auth/login` is now limited to 10 attempts per 15 minutes per client, closing a brute-force gap.
- **Stronger Password Policy, Enforced Server-Side** - Minimum password length raised from 4 to 8 characters, and it's now enforced by the API itself (previously only the frontend checked, so the minimum was trivially bypassable via direct API calls).
- **Security Headers** - Added `helmet` for standard hardening headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `X-Frame-Options`, etc.) on every response. Content-Security-Policy is intentionally left off for now, pending a follow-up pass to verify it against everything the SPA loads.
- **Upload Size Limit** - The asset-import file upload (`POST /api/import/assets`) had no size cap, risking memory exhaustion from a very large file; capped at 25MB.
- **User Role Validation** - `role` is a free-text column; user create/update now rejects anything other than `ADMIN`/`USER` instead of silently accepting arbitrary strings.
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities** - Resolved 10 of 12 `npm audit` findings (all 6 high-severity: `react-router`, `tmp`, `picomatch`, `path-to-regexp`, `minimatch`; plus 4 moderate: `express`, `body-parser`, `qs`, `brace-expansion`). One moderate advisory remains in `uuid` via `exceljs`'s pinned dependency - it only affects a code path (a caller-supplied `buf` argument) that `exceljs` doesn't use, and fixing it upstream would require a breaking downgrade, so it's left as a tracked, low-risk residual.

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/index.ts`: `cors()` now takes `origin: isProduction ? false : /^http:\/\/localhost:\d+$/`; added a startup guard throwing if `SESSION_SECRET` is unset in production; `cookie.secure` now reads `process.env.COOKIE_SECURE === 'true'`; added `cookie.sameSite: 'lax'`; added `app.use(helmet({ contentSecurityPolicy: false }))`
- `apps/api/src/routes/auth.ts`: added `express-rate-limit` on `/login`; added `MIN_PASSWORD_LENGTH` (8) checks to first-admin creation, `/change-password`, `POST /users`, and `/users/:id/reset-password`; added `USER_ROLES` allowlist check to `POST /users` and `PUT /users/:id`
- `apps/api/src/routes/import.ts`: `multer` now has `limits: { fileSize: 25 * 1024 * 1024 }`
- `apps/api/.env.example`: documented the new `COOKIE_SECURE` variable and that `SESSION_SECRET` is now required in production
- `apps/web/src/pages/settings/AccountTab.tsx`, `UsersTab.tsx`: password minimum raised from 4 to 8 to match the server
- Added `helmet` and `express-rate-limit` as new `apps/api` dependencies

---

## [1.22.2] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- **Displayed App Version Was Out of Sync**
  - The version shown in the app footer/About dialog was a separately hand-maintained constant that didn't get updated during the 1.22.0/1.22.1 releases
  - It's now derived from the root `package.json` at build time, so it can no longer drift out of sync with the version bumped in `package.json`/`README.md`/`VERSION_HISTORY.md`

### Technical Details

- `apps/web/vite.config.ts`: reads `../../package.json` at config-load time and injects its `version` via Vite's `define` as a global `__APP_VERSION__` constant
- `apps/web/src/vite-env.d.ts`: new file declaring the `__APP_VERSION__` global for TypeScript
- `apps/web/src/lib/useVersionCheck.ts`: `APP_VERSION` now reads `__APP_VERSION__` instead of a hardcoded string literal

---

## [1.22.1] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **"No Change" Barcode on the Condition Sheet**
  - The printable A4 condition barcode sheet now includes a "No Change" QR code alongside the six condition codes
  - Scanning it clears any locked condition in Quick Verify (equivalent to clicking the "No Change" button), so the lock can be cleared by scanning instead of touching the screen

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/services/labelService.ts`: `CONDITION_LABELS` gains a leading `['NONE', 'No Change']` entry; grid grows from 2x3 to 2x4 to fit the 7th cell (`createConditionSheetPDF()` is otherwise unchanged - it already looped generically over the list)
- `apps/web/src/pages/Stocktake.tsx`: `handleQuickVerify()` special-cases a scanned `CONDITION:NONE` to clear `activeCondition` rather than trying to match it against `CONDITION_LABELS`

---

## [1.22.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- **Printable Stocktake Condition Barcodes**
  - New "Print condition barcodes (A4)" link in the Stocktake Quick Verify panel opens a printable A4 sheet with one scannable QR code per condition (New, Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Non-Functional), each in its own cut-lined cell
  - Scanning one of these codes into Quick Verify locks that condition (same behavior as manually typing `CONDITION:GOOD`, etc.), so a printed sheet can be used to batch-set conditions without typing

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/services/labelService.ts`: new `createConditionSheetPDF()` builds a 2x3 grid A4 PDF using the existing `generateQRCode()` helper, one `CONDITION:<VALUE>` QR per cell
- `apps/api/src/routes/labels.ts`: new `GET /api/labels/condition-sheet` endpoint (session-authenticated, same pattern as `/download-batch`)
- `apps/web/src/pages/Stocktake.tsx`: link opens the endpoint in a new tab via a plain `<a href>` (no download button/modal needed since it takes no parameters)

---

## [1.21.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **Print Dialogs Rework**
  - Label Options (Show Assigned To/Hostname/IP Address) are now always visible in a two-column layout, instead of hidden behind a collapsed toggle
  - QR Code Content choice removed from the print dialogs - now only configurable in Settings > Label Printing
  - New "Label Size" selector lets you choose Brother DK-22211 vs DYMO 1933081 per print/download job, without changing the saved Settings default
  - The label preview now matches the selected label size's real aspect ratio (Brother 62x29mm vs DYMO 89x25mm), instead of a fixed generic box

### Technical Details

- `apps/api/src/routes/labels.ts`: `/preview`, `/print`, `/print-batch`, `/download`, and `/download-batch` all accept an optional `labelType` override now, following the same override pattern already used for `showAssignedTo`/`showHostname`/`showIpAddress`/`qrCodeContent`
- `LabelPreviewModal.tsx` and `BatchPrintModal.tsx`: `isDymo` is now derived from the local per-dialog `labelType` selection rather than only the global settings value

---

## [1.20.8] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **DYMO Label - Dynamic Layout for Missing Hostname/IP**
  - When Hostname/IP isn't shown (disabled in settings, or the asset has neither), Item Number, Model, and Serial Number now grow from 10pt to 13pt and their boxes expand to fill the freed row, instead of leaving blank space
  - No change when Hostname/IP is present - layout stays at 10pt as before

---

## [1.20.7] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **DYMO Label - Layout and Typography Refinements**
  - Item Number, Model, Serial Number, Hostname, and IP Address text are now centered (previously left-aligned)
  - Hostname and IP Address combined onto a single line ("hostname \ ip"), matching the existing PDF label format, freeing up a full row of vertical space
  - Item Number, Model, Serial Number, and the combined Hostname/IP line now all use a matching 10pt font (previously a mix of 9/10/11pt), with evenly spaced boxes

---

## [1.20.6] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **DYMO Label - Organization Name Bold and Repositioned**
  - Organization Name is now bold, matching Assigned To's weight
  - Repositioned closer to the bottom edge of the label for better visual balance, confirmed on a test print

---

## [1.20.5] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **DYMO Label - Organization Name Size and Layout**
  - Organization Name font increased from 7pt to 14pt, matching Assigned To
  - Assigned To and Organization Name were both centered across the full label width, which caused Organization Name to visibly overlap the QR code once enlarged - both are now confined to the same right-hand text column as Item Number/Model/Serial Number, entirely clear of the QR

### Known limitation

- Organization Name's box can still vertically overlap the IP Address line for assets that have an IP address set - not yet fixed

---

## [1.20.4] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **DYMO Label - QR Code Sizing and Position**
  - DYMO's native barcode "Size: Large" auto-sizing wasn't reliably honoring the requested dimensions - two different test sizes printed at inconsistent, incorrect sizes, with visible clipping on one
  - QR code is now rendered as a PNG image and embedded directly in the label (same method already used for the PDF/download path), which scales predictably and precisely
  - QR now prints at the requested 20mm x 20mm
  - Repositioned the QR further from the label's top-left corner, with the text column shifted right to match

### Technical Details

- `buildDymoLabelXml()` is now async - it renders the QR via the existing `generateQRCode()` (bwip-js) and embeds it as a base64 PNG in a DYMO `ImageObject` (`ScaleMode=Fill`) instead of a native `BarcodeObject`
- Both callers in `apps/api/src/routes/labels.ts` (`/dymo-xml/:assetId` and `/dymo-xml-batch`) updated to await it

---

## [1.20.3] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **DYMO Label - Bigger QR Code**
  - Increased the QR code size on DYMO labels from 1200x1200 to 1300x1300 twips (~8% bigger)
  - Text column shifted right slightly (1340 -> 1370 twips) and narrowed to match (3600 -> 3570 twips) to stay clear of the bigger QR, keeping the same right-hand margin

---

## [1.20.2] - 2026-07-02

### Changed

- **DYMO Label - Bigger Assigned To Text**
  - Increased the "Assigned To" name font size on DYMO labels from 10pt to 14pt for better readability
  - Text box height increased to match (180 -> 250 twips)
  - Item Number, Model, Serial Number, Hostname, and IP Address shifted down 70 twips each to stay clear of it, with a safe 55-twip gap kept before the organization name at the bottom

---

## [1.20.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **DYMO Label - Assigned To Text Clipped at Top Edge**
  - Fixed the "Assigned To" name being cut off at the top of printed DYMO labels
  - Top margin was only 30 twips (~0.5mm), too tight for bold/capital letters near the physical edge of the label
  - Moved Assigned To, Item Number, Model, and Serial Number text blocks down by 100 twips (~1.76mm) to give proper clearance, keeping their relative spacing unchanged

---

## [1.20.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **DYMO LabelWriter 450 Twin Turbo - Roll Selection**
  - New "Roll (Twin Turbo)" dropdown (Auto / Left / Right) in the print dialog and batch print dialog for DYMO labels
  - Only shown when the detected local printer is actually a Twin Turbo model - no change for single-roll LabelWriters
  - Fixes labels always printing to the right-side roll on Twin Turbo printers, with no way to choose the left roll instead
  - Roll choice is remembered per-device (localStorage), same as the printer selection

### Technical Details

- `dymo.connect.framework.js` reports `isTwinTurbo` per detected printer and accepts a `TwinTurboRoll` ("Auto"/"Left"/"Right") print parameter - both were already supported by the vendored SDK, just not wired into the UI
- `apps/web/src/lib/dymoLabelPrinter.ts`: `listDymoPrinters()` now returns `{ name, isTwinTurbo }`; `printDymoLabel()` takes an optional roll argument
- `useDymoPrinting` hook tracks the selected roll and persists it via `dymo.lastRoll` in localStorage

---

## [1.19.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed

- **DYMO Label Printing - XML Schema Errors**
  - Fixed "PrintLabel" failing with HTTP 400 against DYMO Label Software's local web service
  - QR code `BarcodeObject` now includes the required `QuietZonesPadding` element
  - Text object `Attributes` now include `ForeColor` alongside `Font`, as DYMO's schema requires both
  - Removed XML comments from the generated label template - DYMO's label parser doesn't tolerate them, unlike a standard XML parser
  - DYMO labels now print successfully end-to-end from the browser

---

## [1.19.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **DYMO Label Printing from the Browser**
  - DYMO labels can now be printed directly, instead of download-only
  - Detects DYMO Label Software running on the user's own device and lists its local printers
  - Print modal and batch print modal show a per-device printer picker for DYMO labels
  - Falls back to "Download PDF" with a specific reason (not installed / not running / unsupported browser) when DYMO Label Software isn't detected on the device

### Technical Details

- Root cause of previous DYMO printing attempts: the printer is attached to each user's own PC, not the server, so backend calls to the local DYMO web service (127.0.0.1:41951) could never reach it. Printing now happens client-side in the browser instead, where that address correctly resolves to the user's own machine.
- Vendored DYMO's official `dymo.connect.framework.js` SDK (`apps/web/public/vendor/`), lazy-loaded only when a DYMO print UI is shown
- New `buildDymoLabelXml()` in `labelService-dymo.ts` generates native DYMO DieCutLabel XML; new endpoints `GET /labels/dymo-xml/:assetId` and `GET /labels/dymo-xml-batch` return label XML only, with the actual print call made by the browser
- New `apps/web/src/lib/dymoLabelPrinter.ts` and `useDymoPrinting` hook wrap the SDK for environment detection, printer listing, and printing
- Settings page hides the (server-side) printer dropdown for DYMO, since printing is now selected per-device in the print dialog
- Existing server-side DYMO PDF print path (`pdf-to-printer`) left in place for the "Download PDF" fallback

---

## [1.18.4] - 2026-03-20

### Fixed

---

## [1.18.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- **CSV Import - UTF-8 BOM Handling**
  - Fixed "Invalid Opening Quote" error when importing CSV files exported from Excel
  - CSV parser now removes UTF-8 BOM (Byte Order Mark) before parsing
  - BOM is a special character that some applications add to UTF-8 files
  - Imports now work seamlessly with Excel-exported CSV files

---

## [1.18.0] - 2026-03-04

### Added

  - Print button disabled when DYMO label type is selected; shows "DYMO is Download only" message
  - Users can download DYMO label PDFs for manual printing or external label printer software

### Technical Details

- New label service: `labelService-dymo.ts` handles DYMO-specific PDF generation
- Label dimensions: 85mm width × 23mm height (adjustable via constants)
- Text centering calculated to account for QR code area (margin 3pt + QR 45pt + gap 1pt = 49pt)
- All font sizes reduced by 1pt from previous version for better fit on smaller label
- QR code generation consistent with existing bwip-js implementation
- Backend checks `labelType === 'dymo-1933081'` to route requests to correct service
- Frontend UI prevents printing when DYMO is selected, enforcing download-only workflow

---

## [1.15.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **"Waiting Repair" Status Support in Stocktakes**
  - Assets with "Waiting Repair" status are now included when creating stocktakes
  - Previously only "In Use", "Awaiting allocation", "Awaiting delivery", and "Awaiting collection" statuses were included
  - Allows inventory verification of assets currently waiting for repair service

---

## [1.15.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Audio Beep Feedback for Stocktake Scanning**
  - Distinct audio cues for different scan outcomes during stocktake:
    - **Success**: Single short high-pitched beep (1880 Hz, 120 ms) — confirms item scanned successfully
    - **Already Scanned (Duplicate)**: Two medium beeps (880 Hz, 120 ms each, 80 ms gap) — warns that item was already verified
    - **Error**: Single long low-pitched beep (220 Hz, 400 ms) — indicates item not found or invalid scan
  - Improves stocktake workflow by providing immediate audio feedback without requiring users to watch the screen
  - Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) using Web Audio API
  - Gracefully falls back to silent if audio is not supported

---

  - Click to navigate directly to the asset detail page
  - External link icon indicates the cell is clickable
  - Free IPs (without linked assets) display "-" as before

---

## [1.13.0] - 2026-02-18

### Added

- **QR Code Content Option for Labels**
  - Users can now choose between two QR code encoding modes:
    - **Full**: Encodes all label information (Assigned To, Item, Model, S/N, Hostname, IP, Organization)
    - **Item Number Only**: Encodes just the item number for simpler QR codes
  - Setting available in Settings → Label Printing
  - Per-print override available in Print Label modal

- **Stocktake Condition Scanning with Mode Toggle**
  - Improved quick-verify workflow with two condition-setting modes:
    - **Single Asset**: Condition applies to next scanned asset only, then resets
    - **Continuous**: Condition locks in place until changed (efficient for bulk scanning groups)
  - Visual condition buttons replace dropdown (No Change, New, Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Non-functional)
  - Colored condition buttons with active state indicator

## [1.12.3] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **Subnet Tab Switching Unresponsiveness on IP Addresses Page**
  - Fixed unresponsiveness when changing subnets on the IP addresses page
  - **Root Cause**: Sorting and pagination state from previous subnet carried over when switching tabs
  - **Solution**: Force component remount when subnet changes using React key prop
  - **Technical**: Added `key={activeTabId}` to SubnetIPTable component in Network page
  - Added `useEffect` as backup to reset state when subnet changes
  - Now switches between subnets smoothly with fresh state

### Technical Details

- SubnetIPTable now remounts completely when subnet changes (using React key prop)
- Added useEffect cleanup for state reset (`sorting`, `page`, `limit`) as additional safeguard
- Ensures no state carryover between subnet tabs

---

## [1.12.2] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **Report Tables & IP Address Table Unresponsiveness**
  - Fixed critical performance issue where sorting and pagination caused UI freezing
  - **Root Cause**: Sorting was applied to paginated data (current page only) instead of the complete dataset
  - **Solution**: Pass all data to TanStack Table for sorting, then paginate the sorted results
  - **Impact**: All report tables and IP address browser now respond instantly to sort and pagination actions
  - **Affected Components**:
    - Stocktake Review Report
    - Warranty Expiry Report
    - Asset Value Report
    - Age & Lifecycle Report
    - Condition Report
    - IP Address Browser
  - **Bonus**: Sorting now automatically resets page to 1 for better UX

### Technical Details

- Added page reset (`setPage(1)`) in `onSortingChange` callback for all tables
- All tables now pass full data to TanStack `useReactTable()` instead of paginated slice
- Extracted sorted rows and then applied pagination for rendering

---
