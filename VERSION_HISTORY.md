#### Backend Enhancements

## [1.7.1] - 2026-02-15

### Bug Fixes

- **Label Printing in Service Mode**: Fixed "Failed to print label" error and printer margin issues
  - Replaced PowerShell-based printing (`Start-Process -Verb Print`) with native Windows printing API via `pdf-to-printer` library
  - Set explicit DK-22211 paper size (29x62mm) with "fit" scaling to use full label area
  - Removed SYSTEM user account option in installer; service now always runs as current logged-in user
  - SYSTEM user account lacks proper printer access and caused 16mm margins on printed labels
  - Service running as current user ensures consistent printer behavior between dev and production

### Installation Improvements

- **Service Account Configuration**: Updated `install.ps1` to configure service to run as current user
  - Prompts for user password during installation for secure service account setup
  - Ensures label printing works correctly with proper printer access
  - Eliminates printer margin issues that occurred with SYSTEM account

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-02-15

### New Features

- **Bulk Edit Assets**: Select multiple assets from the list and edit shared fields at once
  - "Edit Selected (N)" button appears when assets are checked
  - Modal allows updating: Status, Condition, Category, Location, Decommission Date, and Comments
  - Only filled fields are applied (leave blank to skip)
  - Success/failure summary shows count of updated assets and any errors
  - Full audit logging with human-readable field names
- **Auto-Set Decommission Date**: When an asset status is changed to any "Decommissioned" variant, the Decommission Date is automatically set to today
  - Works in both individual asset editing and bulk edit modal
  - User can manually override the date if needed

### Improvements

- **Audit Log Display**: BULK_UPDATE actions now show detailed field changes
  - Lookup fields (Location, Category, Manufacturer, Supplier) display friendly names instead of raw IDs
  - Example: "Location: (empty) → Conference Room A" instead of UUID
  - Improved readability for tracking what actually changed

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-02-15

### New Features

- **Bulk Add Assets**: New dedicated page for adding multiple assets at once
  - Enter serial numbers and assigned-to names as side-by-side lists (one per line)

  - Accessible via "Bulk Add" button on the asset list

### Bug Fixes

  - Eliminates orphaned lock file issue where updates appeared stuck

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-02-14

  - "All Statuses" option available to show everything including decommissioned

  - Displays current version, changelog summary parsed from GitHub, and copyright info
  - Links to GitHub repository and full changelog
  - Admin users can trigger updates directly from the modal
  - Non-admin users see a link to GitHub releases

### Bug Fixes

- **Update Lock File**: Fixed `update.lock` not being deleted after web update completes
  - Lock file now removed before service restart to avoid script-on-disk changes from `git pull` corrupting the `finally` block
  - `finally` block retained as safety net for failure cases

### Changes

- Sidebar version text is replaced by "Update to vX.X.X" notification when an update is available
- Update confirmation moved from browser `confirm()` dialog to the About modal
- Removed hardcoded default credentials from install script; first login creates the admin account
- Updated README with one-line install command and link to manual install guide

---

## [1.3.2] - 2026-02-14

### Bug Fixes

- **Web Update Process Fix**: Fixed update script being killed when NSSM stops the service
  - NSSM uses Windows Job Objects to kill the entire process tree when stopping the service
  - Update now runs via Windows Task Scheduler, fully independent of the NSSM service
  - Reuses existing `update.ps1` with new `-AutoUpdate` parameter (skips confirmation, logs to file)
  - Scheduled task created during installation via `install.ps1`
  - `update.ps1` try/finally block ensures service restart and lock file cleanup even on failure

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-13

### Bug Fixes

- **Login Fix**: Fixed issue where users had to log in twice after application boot
  - Login now sets auth data directly in the query cache instead of relying on a background refetch
  - Eliminates race condition between navigation and auth status check
- **Web Update Fix**: Fixed 500 error when triggering update from web interface
  - Ensures logs directory is created automatically if it doesn't exist
  - Improved error messages for easier debugging

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### New Features

- **Web-Based Update**: Admins can trigger system updates directly from the web interface
  - "Update to v{x.y.z}" button appears in sidebar when a new version is detected

  - Automatically reloads the page when the update completes and service restarts
  - Backs up database, pulls code, rebuilds, and restarts service automatically
  - Update logs saved to server logs directory
  - Only available to admin users in production mode
- **Brother QL Printer Support**: Updated from QL-500 only to support all Brother QL printer models
  - Users select their specific printer model from the available printers list in Settings
  - Label format unchanged (DK-22211, 29mm continuous tape)
- **NSSM via Chocolatey**: Install script now uses `choco install nssm` instead of direct download from nssm.cc (more reliable)
- **dotenv Support**: Production server now loads `.env` file via dotenv as fallback for environment variables

### Changes
